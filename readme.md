#[SuperLogger](https://dev.bukkit.org/)

SuperLogger is a [bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) plugin focused on logging events  
What's so special about something logging events you may ask?  
Well, we don't just log everything to one, long, hard to read file  
We decided to categorize them, and sort them by date!

If you want to edit this code yourself, you'll need to manually add a *craftbukkit or spigot jar* (not bukkit, we need access to GSON which is only in the other jars)
